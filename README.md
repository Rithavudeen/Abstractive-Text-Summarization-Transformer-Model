# 🤖 Abstractive Text Summarization Transformer Model

A deep-learning project focused on building an abstractive text summarization system using state-of-the-art Transformer architectures to generate concise summaries from longer text inputs.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project covers a full pipeline: dataset ingestion and preprocessing, Transformer-based model design (e.g., encoder-decoder architectures), fine-tuning on summarization datasets, evaluating with metrics like ROUGE, and inference/deployment of the summarizer. The aim is to produce human-like summaries that effectively capture the key information of the source text.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** PyTorch (or TensorFlow/Keras), Hugging Face Transformers, datasets, numpy, pandas
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab / GPU
* **Models:** T5, BART, Pegasus (common architectures for abstractive summarization) ([GitHub][1])

## 🔄 Workflow Summary

### 1. Data Collection

* Load summarization datasets (e.g., news articles and reference summaries)
* Example: InShorts, CNN/DailyMail or XSum datasets used for abstractive summarization tasks ([Kaggle][2])
* Clean and prepare the dataset: remove nulls, unify formats, ensure input-target alignment

### 2. Exploratory Analysis & Pre-processing

* Examine input and summary length distributions
* Visualise token lengths, vocabulary overlap, domain differences
* Encode/clean text (lowercasing, punctuation handling, truncation)
* Tokenize using the model’s tokenizer, set max input/output lengths

### 3. Feature Engineering & Model Preparation

* Use pretrained tokenizer and model checkpoint
* Configure encoder-decoder model (max input_length, max target_length, num_beams for inference)
* Possibly add custom modifications like length penalty, early stopping
* Split dataset into training, validation, and test sets with consistent preprocessing

### 4. Modelling: Training & Fine-tuning

* Fine-tune a pretrained Transformer model (e.g., T5, BART, Pegasus) on the summarization dataset
* Use training loop or Hugging Face’s Trainer API for efficient training ([GitHub][3])
* Monitor training/validation loss, early stop or checkpoint best model
* Evaluate on test set using summarization metrics (ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L)

### 5. Evaluation & Inference

* Compute metrics: MAJOR ones are ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L to compare summaries with references ([GitHub][3])
* Qualitative review: sample generated summaries vs ground truth
* Use model for inference: provide article as input, obtain generated summary

### 6. Deployment & Usage

* Export model (Hugging Face format, PyTorch checkpoint)
* Provide example notebook or script to run summarization
* Optionally deploy via web-app (Streamlit/Gradio) or API (FastAPI/Flask)

## 📈 Key Findings

* Pretrained models like Pegasus/BART provided strong baseline performance with fewer epochs compared to training from scratch
* Fine-tuning with the right hyperparameters (e.g., num_beams, no_repeat_ngram_size) significantly improves summary quality
* Evaluation metrics (ROUGE) give numeric insight but human review is still valuable for fluency and factual correctness
* Summarization models remain sensitive to input length and domain — domain adaptation or longer-context models help

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Use longer-context models or adaptive input length for summarising documents beyond typical length
* Incorporate factual-consistency checks or retrieval-augmented summarization to reduce hallucinations
* Deploy live inference service via web or mobile for end-user usage
* Monitor for model drift or domain shift when applying to new content types
* Explore multimodal summarization (text + image) or multilingual summarization
